## Overview

This project focuses on developing a model to recognize sign language gestures from images or video frames. The model is trained to identify various hand gestures that correspond to different signs in the sign language.

## Features

- **Real-time Sign Language Recognition**: The model can recognize gestures in real-time using a webcam or video feed.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved through the use of advanced deep learning techniques.
- **User-friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for users to interact with the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images or videos of various sign language gestures. The dataset can be obtained from [insert source, e.g., Kaggle, custom dataset, etc.]. For instance, you can use the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (depending on the framework used)
- **OpenCV** (for video processing)
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** (for the web interface)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gowtham611/sign_language.git
   cd sign_language
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Architecture

Describe the architecture of your model here. For example:

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Used for image-based gesture recognition.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Used for sequence-based gesture recognition.
- **Transfer Learning**: Using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, etc., for better performance.

## Training

Outline the training process here. Include information on data augmentation, optimization techniques, loss functions, etc.

## Evaluation

Explain how the model is evaluated. Include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

## Results

Provide details on the results achieved by the model. Include examples of predictions, accuracy scores, and any visualizations.
